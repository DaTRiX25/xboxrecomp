# Custom soundtracks: the user's music folder

`src/soundtrack` (library `xbox_soundtrack`, header `xbox_soundtrack.h`) lets
a title that plays Xbox custom soundtracks play a folder of the user's own
music. It is opt-in: nothing in it runs until the host calls
`xbox_SoundtrackInit` with a folder, and a port that never calls it links
code that is never reached.

## What a title does

A title with the feature links the XDK soundtrack library. Its strings are in
the executable: `\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\TDATA\FFFE0000\MUSIC\ST.DB` and
`%s%04x\%08x.WMA`. The library reads the database the dashboard wrote when it
ripped a CD, and the title decodes the songs, WMA files, with the XDK's WMA
decoder into a DirectSound stream.

| XDK function | reads |
|---|---|
| `XFindFirstSoundtrack` / `XFindNextSoundtrack` | ST.DB: the header, then one soundtrack block a call |
| `XGetSoundtrackSongInfo(soundtrack, index, &id, &ms, name, n)` | ST.DB: the soundtrack's block, the song's group block |
| `XOpenSoundtrackSong(id, async)` | opens `MUSIC\<id >> 16, %04x>\<id, %08x>.WMA`, returns the handle |

## ST.DB

512-byte blocks, little-endian. Read from the library's code in a title
(Burnout 3: 0x001D0134-0x001D05E4); the same layout is described at
<https://xboxdevwiki.net/Soundtracks> and written by
<https://github.com/allkern/stdbtool>.

| block | contents |
|---|---|
| 0 | `u32 magic = 1`, `u32 soundtracks`, `u32 next soundtrack id`, `u32 id[100]`, `u32 next song id` |
| 1..100 | soundtrack: `u32 magic = 0x00021371`, `u32 id`, `u32 songs`, `u32 group[84]`, `u32 total ms`, `u16 name[32]` |
| 101.. | song group: `u32 magic = 0x00031073`, `u32 soundtrack id`, `u32 group id`, `u32 pad`, `u32 song id[6]`, `u32 ms[6]`, `u16 name[6][32]` |

Soundtrack i of the header's id list is block 1 + i; group g is block
101 + g; song n of a soundtrack is slot n % 6 of its group n / 6. Limits: 100
soundtracks, 84 groups (the dashboard stopped at 500 songs) a soundtrack,
names of 31 UTF-16 units.

`xst_db_build` writes soundtrack ids from 1 and song ids as
`(soundtrack id << 16) | index`: the library keeps the last soundtrack it
read in a zero-initialised cache keyed by id, so id 0 would match the empty
cache.

## The folder

`xst_scan(dir)`: every folder that holds playable files is one soundtrack,
named after the folder: the chosen folder itself (its loose files), then the
folders below it in natural order, six levels deep. Songs are in natural
order of file name ("2" before "10") and named by the title tag (ID3v2,
Vorbis comment), else the file name without its extension. Entries with a
leading dot are skipped. Past the limits, folders and songs are left out and
counted (`dropped_folders`, `dropped_songs`), files that do not open are
counted (`bad_files`); `xbox_SoundtrackInit` logs the counts.

Names are kept to Latin-1 (`xst_name_from_utf8`): a title's menu font goes no
further (Burnout 3's draws a box for U+0151). Decomposed letters (macOS file
names) are composed, Latin Extended-A is folded to the nearest letter ("ő"
to "ö", "ř" to "r"), typographic quotes and dashes to the plain ones, and
other scripts to "?".

The scan reads headers only: a FLAC's stream info, an Ogg's last page, a
WAV's header, and for an mp3 the first 64 KiB of its ID3v2 tag and its first
frame (the Xing/Info frame count, else size over bitrate).

## Decoding

`xst_stream_open(path)` / `xst_stream_read`: any of the formats as 44.1 kHz
16-bit stereo, the format the dashboard ripped to and what a title opens its
stream with. Other rates go through a 32-tap Kaiser-windowed sinc with the
cutoff under the lower Nyquist rate; mono is doubled, of more than two
channels the front pair is taken (with the centre at -3 dB).

| format | decoder | licence |
|---|---|---|
| mp3 | dr_mp3 0.7.4 (minimp3 inside) | public domain / MIT-0 (minimp3: CC0) |
| flac | dr_flac 0.13.4 | public domain / MIT-0 |
| wav | dr_wav 0.14.6 | public domain / MIT-0 |
| ogg (Vorbis) | stb_vorbis 1.22 | public domain / MIT |

All single files under `third_party/`, compiled into `xst_decode.c`; no
library is linked, so every host (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android) builds the
same code. Not played: m4a/AAC and Opus (no single-file decoder with a
permissive licence), WMA (the title's own decoder plays a console's real
`MUSIC` folder, see below).

## On the emulated disk

`xbox_SoundtrackInit(music_dir)` scans, writes the database to
`<save dir>/TDATA/FFFE0000/MUSIC.HOST/ST.DB` and installs a path redirect
(`xbox_PathRedirectHook`, chaining to one already there): every path under
`...\TDATA\FFFE0000\MUSIC\` opens that file. For `ST.DB` that is the
database; for a song it is merely a file that opens, since a title only
passes the handle on to its decoder.

A real `MUSIC` folder copied from a console into the save folder is not
touched: with the setting empty the title reads it as before, through its
own WMA decoder.

## What the port adds

Two guest functions, wrapped in the port's `recomp_manual.c` (the
recompiler's `sub_X` / `sub_X_gen` wrap):

1. the title's `XOpenSoundtrackSong`: after it, the port calls
   `xbox_SoundtrackNoteOpen(handle, song id)`;
2. the function that makes the WMA decoder for a handle: the port calls
   `xbox_SoundtrackOpenHandle(handle, &ours)` and, when the handle is one of
   ours, returns an object of its own in place of the XDK's: a vtable of the
   ten `XFileMediaObject` methods whose `Process` copies
   `xst_stream_read` into the title's packet.

Burnout 3's are in `src/game/soundtrack.c` of that port, with the addresses
and the player's state machine. Everything after the decoder (the title's
stream, its volume and mix bins, pause, skip, shuffle) is the title's code,
unchanged.

## Settings

`audio.custom_music_dir` in settings.toml (a text setting:
`xbox_SettingsText`), `RECOMP_AUDIO_MUSIC_DIR` in the environment. Empty is
off. Read at start: a change shows after a restart.

## Test

`tests/soundtrack`: the natural order, the names, a scan of a folder tree it
makes, the ST.DB image read back the way the XDK library reads it, the
limits, and the decoders (pass-through at 44.1 kHz; a 1 kHz tone through the
resampler from 22.05, 48 and 96 kHz and through mp3, FLAC and Ogg: frequency
and level; a 30 kHz tone at 96 kHz filtered out). The encoded fixtures in
`data/` are half a second of a sine made by `make_fixtures.sh`.
