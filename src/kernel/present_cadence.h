/*
 * present_cadence.h - when frames reach the glass: the strategy per display,
 * the target time of each present, and the statistics the overlay's graph
 * and RECOMP_TRACE=glass show (BO-115).
 *
 * A 60 fps title is smooth only when every frame stays on the screen for the
 * same time. The flip-to-flip interval says when the title finished a frame;
 * it does not say when the display showed it. On a 120 Hz panel a present
 * that lands a little early or late is shown one refresh early or late: the
 * frames last 1, 3, 2, 2 ... refreshes while the flip graph is flat. Under
 * variable refresh there is no grid at all, and every bit of present-time
 * jitter is on the glass.
 *
 * Everything here is arithmetic on host nanoseconds with no clock, lock or
 * platform call of its own (tests/present_cadence drives it). The Metal
 * presenter feeds it (fb_present_metal.m: CAMetalLayer, presentedTime); the
 * other presenters are as they were, and the overlay says "not available"
 * for them.
 *
 * Strategies (pc_pick), with display.present_timing = auto:
 *
 *   PC_LOCK       a fixed-rate display whose rate is a multiple of 60
 *                 (60/120/240 Hz). The emulated vblank is moved onto the
 *                 display's grid, `phase` before a refresh (the presenter
 *                 reports each on-glass time less the phase to
 *                 xbox_VblankDisplayRefresh), and each frame is presented
 *                 for one named refresh: the one `depth` refreshes after
 *                 the refresh its vblank sits before. Every frame is shown
 *                 for the same number of refreshes; a frame that misses its
 *                 refresh (a slip) is counted, and four in two seconds
 *                 raise the depth by one, while that still leaves the frame
 *                 on the glass inside two frames of its vblank.
 *   PC_TIMED      a variable-refresh display (VRR, ProMotion). The vblank
 *                 keeps its own 60.000 Hz timer and each frame is presented
 *                 at its vblank plus a fixed lead: the display refreshes
 *                 when the frame arrives, so equal present times are equal
 *                 on-glass times. Frames that arrive late raise the lead.
 *   PC_TIMED_ODD  a fixed-rate display that is not a multiple of 60 (75,
 *                 100, 144 Hz): as PC_TIMED; the cadence cannot be even
 *                 there and the overlay says so.
 *   PC_LEGACY     display.present_timing = legacy: present when ready, as
 *                 before BO-115. Measured all the same.
