/*
 * kernel_pause.h - the host pause: the in-game settings overlay stops the
 * title while it is open.
 *
 * The title is held where the console's GPU would hold it. The executor (the
 * nv2a-ack thread, which stands in for the GPU) stops at FLIP_STALL, after
 * the frame is presented (xbox_HostPauseHold); the title's CPU then runs into
 * its own fence and pushbuffer-space waits within a frame or two and stops
 * there, which is what a stalled GPU does on the console. Nothing in the
 * title is suspended from outside, so no lock can be held across the pause
 * and no guest thread is stopped mid-instruction.
 *
 * Listeners are told of each change on the calling thread: the APU stops its
 * frame thread, so the title's sound does not play on (and its streaming,
 * which follows the play cursor, waits with it).
 *
 * The game time is not frozen: the vblank keeps counting and the host
 * clocks run. A title that steps its simulation by elapsed time is bounded
 * by its own catch-up limit (Burnout 3's sub_001B58E0: at most four steps a
 * frame), so it comes back with one frame of catch-up at most.
 *
 * A pause is taken at the next flip, so it waits out a load or a movie that
 * does not flip; the overlay opens at once either way.
