/*
 * kernel_saveguard.h - a title's save files are replaced, not overwritten.
 *
 * A console title writes its save in place: it opens the file, sets its
 * size, writes, closes. On the console the worst an interruption costs is
 * that one save. On a PC the process can be killed, the battery can run out
 * and the disk can fill at any of those steps, and what is left is a file
 * of the right name with half a save in it.
 *
 * With the guard on, a file under the title's save trees (UDATA\<id>,
 * TDATA\<id>) that is opened for writing is not the file itself but a new
 * file beside it, "<name>.~new", which starts as a copy of the old one.
 * The title writes there. When its last handle closes, a thread of the
 * guard's own flushes the new file to the disk and renames it over the old
 * name. The old file is whole until that rename and the new one is whole
 * after it; there is no moment with half of each.
 *
 * Off unless the port turns it on; with it off, the file layer does
 * exactly what it did.
 *
 * What it does not cover: a file the title renames by handle while it is
 * being written keeps its old name's file as it was (the renamed one is
 * the new name's file); a handle opened relative to a directory handle on
 * Windows is written in place, as before.
