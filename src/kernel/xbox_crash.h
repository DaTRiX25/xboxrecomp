/*
 * xbox_crash.h - crash and hang reports, one folder each.
 *
 * A report is a directory <save dir>/crash/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<kind>/ with
 *
 *   report.txt    what happened: the signal or exception, the host
 *                 backtrace, the guest registers and the guest call stack
 *                 (tools/stackwalk.py's format, and its raw "GS slot word"
 *                 lines, so `stackwalk.py functions.json < report.txt`
 *                 redoes it offline with real function bounds)
 *   log.txt       the last 500 lines of stdout and stderr
 *   settings.txt  the effective settings: what the host passed to
 *                 xbox_crash_set_settings and every RECOMP_* value the
 *                 runtime's table holds
 *   minidump.dmp  Windows only, written by the host
 *
 * Beside the reports, <save dir>/logs keeps the log of this run and of the
 * three before it (see xbox_crash_set_run_log).
 *
 * The log lines come from a tee: xbox_crash_init points fds 1 and 2 at
 * pipes, and a thread copies what arrives to the original destination and
 * into a ring. Nothing that prints has to know.
 *
 * The hang watchdog counts the title's flips (FLIP_STALL, g_xbox_flip_count)
 * and writes a "hang" report when they stop for RECOMP_HANG_WATCHDOG seconds
 * (default 15, 0 off; 60 before the first flip). The Windows host had a
 * sampler under that name that only printed; this is the same idea on every
 * host, with a report on disk.
 *
 * Writers are meant to be called from a fault handler: no allocation, and on
 * POSIX only calls that are async-signal-safe or, like snprintf and dladdr,
 * safe in practice (as the BLiNX 2 handler this grew from accepts).
