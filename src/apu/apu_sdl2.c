/**
 * SDL2 Audio Output Backend (POSIX hosts)
 *
 * The xa2_* contract of apu_xaudio2.h on macOS and Linux: the APU frame
 * thread hands over one EP period (256 stereo frames) at a time, and the
 * device queue paces it (mcpx_apu_pace_step reads xa2_queued_samples).
 * SDL's push API (SDL_QueueAudio) is the queue; its device thread pulls one
 * device buffer per callback and pads a short pull with silence, which is
 * why the pacing marks keep at least one device buffer queued.
 *
 * Headless runs (RECOMP_HEADLESS=1) use SDL's "dummy" driver unless
 * SDL_AUDIODRIVER is already set: it drains the queue in real time without
 * a device, so pacing and the WAV tap behave as on a real device and nothing
 * reaches the speakers. SDL_AUDIODRIVER=coreaudio (or pulseaudio, pipewire)
 * with RECOMP_HEADLESS=1 is the way to hear a headless run.
 *
 * 5.1: the device is opened with six channels when the title mixes 5.1 and
 * the default output takes six (or cannot say: SDL and the sound server
 * convert then), with two when the default output is known to be stereo, in
 * which case apu_core.c folds the period down first. SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo
 * (SDL >= 2.24) is the probe; PipeWire, PulseAudio and CoreAudio answer it
 * with the channel count the system's output profile is set to. An audio
 * device added or removed (SDL_AUDIODEVICEADDED/REMOVED, seen by an event
 * watch on whichever thread SDL posts them from) makes the frame thread ask
 * again at its next period and reopen the device if the answer changed.
 *
 * A device that stops (BO-118). The frame thread waits on the queue's depth,
 * so a device thread that no longer pulls would stop the APU, and a title
 * that waits on the APU with it (Burnout 3 spins in DirectSound's doorbell
 * poll). It happened on Linux after the machine woke: SDL 3's PipeWire sink
 * moved the stream to the new default output on its hotplug thread, waited
 * there for ever for a stream that never started, and held the device's
 * lock, which the old device's thread then waited on. So:
 *
 *   - Half a second without a sample taken, with a buffer queued, is a
 *     stall. From then the queue is a pretend one that empties at 48 kHz
 *     (what SDL's dummy driver does): the APU keeps its pace and what it
 *     renders is dropped. A buffer of silence is left queued; when the
 *     device takes from it, it is back.
 *   - Still stalled after four seconds, or gone: the device is closed and
 *     the default opened again, every five seconds until one opens.
 *   - Whatever of SDL can wait on a device's lock (probe, close, open) runs
 *     on a worker thread, never on the frame thread: a call that does not
 *     come back costs the sound, not the game, and the log says so.
 *   - After a gap in the run (host_time.h: the machine slept, the process
 *     was stopped) the queue is dropped, the device closed and the default
 *     output opened anew (why: service()).
