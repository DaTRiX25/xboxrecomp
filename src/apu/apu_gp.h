/*
 * apu_gp.h -- a title's GP effects image, modelled.
 *
 * On the console the Global Processor (a DSP56300) runs the effects image
 * the title gave DirectSound: it takes the 32 mixbins the voice processor
 * summed, runs the image's effect chain over them and leaves the six
 * speaker feeds. No DSP56300 runs here. A title whose image has been read
 * describes it with the calls below (which effect sits on which bin, where
 * its state is) and this module does what those effects do, with the
 * parameters the title itself keeps writing:
 *
 *   state    DirectSound keeps every effect's state block in GP scratch
 *            memory and tells the GP program to load a part of it with a
 *            command (apu_gp_command). The model has the same state words
 *            and loads them at the same moments, so a parameter moves when
 *            it does on the console, and an effect's own running state is
 *            overwritten when a load covers it, as there.
 *   direct   a bin summed into a speaker with a fixed gain (the speaker
 *            bins themselves).
 *   eq       the image's IIR2 effect: a bin through a biquad into one
 *            speaker. Its b0 is the send's gain and sign.
 *   drive    the image's in-place distortion (a wave folder into a state
 *            variable low-pass, mixed under the amplified dry signal), in
 *            the DSP's own 56-bit fixed point.
 *   export   the GP program's copy of a run of bins, after the in-place
 *            effects, into GP scratch memory every frame: what a title's
 *            "return" voices play from (their buffers lie on it).
 *   LFE      a 120 Hz low-pass on the LFE feed, as the console's AC-3
 *            encoder had after the GP. Not part of the image.
 *
 * Bins nothing is wired to reach no speaker, as on the console.
 *
 * Pure: no APU state, no clock; memory is reached through apu_gp_mem. One
 * instance, used on the APU frame thread.
