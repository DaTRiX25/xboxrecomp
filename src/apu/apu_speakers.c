/*
 * apu_speakers.c -- mixbins to the six speaker feeds, and 5.1 to stereo.
 *
 * Which bin is which speaker is DirectSound's, not the hardware's: the XDK's
 * DSMIXBIN_* numbering (Cxbx-Reloaded src/core/hle/DSOUND/XbDSoundTypes.h
 * lists the speaker half, XDSMIXBIN_FRONT_LEFT .. XDSMIXBIN_BACK_RIGHT = 0..5,
 * XDSMIXBIN_SPEAKERS_MAX 6):
 *
 *     0 front left    1 front right   2 center    3 LFE
 *     4 back left     5 back right
 *     6..9  XTLK front left/right, back left/right: 3D voices after the VP's
 *           HRTF, which the GP's crosstalk effect folds back into 0,1,4,5
 *     10    I3DL2 reverb send
 *     11..  FX sends, the inputs of the title's own GP effect chains
 *
 * On the console the GP's DSP program reads all 32 bins from its mix buffer
 * and leaves the finished speaker feeds in bins 0..5 of that same buffer:
 * xemu reads the GP's output back from X:0x1400 + bin * 0x20, which is
 * GP_DSP_MIXBUF_BASE, where it wrote the VP's bins (xemu
 * hw/xbox/mcpx/apu/dsp/gp_ep.c, mcpx_apu_dsp_frame; apu_regs.h). The EP then
 * encodes those six to AC-3, or folds them for the analog output.
 *
 * No DSP runs here, so the effects are bypassed and every bin goes to one
 * speaker (apu_spk_default_map): 0..5 to their own, the XTLK bins to the
 * speakers the crosstalk effect would have folded them into (without its
 * filter), and the sends (10 and up) to the front pair, even bins left and
 * odd right -- the same fold the stereo path (apu_dsp.c) gives every bin, so
 * a send is as loud in 5.1 as in stereo. A reverb send heard dry is not a
 * reverb; it is what the stereo path has always done with it.
 *
 * Which speaker an FX send ends up on is the title's: its effects image
 * routes each send through its own chain to a speaker, with a gain and a
 * sign, and may take a send to no speaker at all (a bin that only feeds an
 * in-place effect whose output the title plays back through a voice). A
 * map of bin to speaker cannot say that: a title that mixes its 5.1 sounds
 * into sends (Burnout 3 does) wires a model of its image instead
 * (apu_gp.h), and the map here is then the model's routing. A title
 * without one may still hand a plain map to mcpx_apu_set_speaker_map.
