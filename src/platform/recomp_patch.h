/*
 * recomp_patch.h - the runtime half of the opt-in guest patches.
 *
 * tools.recomp --patches (tools/recomp/patches.py) follows a listed guest
 * load with
 *
 *     reg = RECOMP_PATCH_U32("game.speed_units", "kmh", 2u, reg);
 *
 * which lands in recomp_patch_u32: the value the guest loaded comes back
 * unchanged unless the setting named by `key` currently reads `when`, then
 * `value` does. A host opts a setting in with recomp_patch_enable, naming
 * the environment variable that carries it; that variable is the one the
 * overlay and settings.toml drive (xbox_settings.h), so a change is seen by
 * the next load, and the environment (RECOMP_SPEED_UNITS=kmh) works with no
 * overlay built. A setting nobody enabled is "off": the title runs as it was.
 *
 * A float patch ("load_f32", "store_f32") carries an expression instead of a
 * constant:
 *
 *     xmm0.f[0] = RECOMP_PATCH_F32("display.hud_fix", "1", 0,
 *         ((double)(xmm0.f[0]) + (640.0 - 480.0 * recomp_patch_var("aspect")) / 2.0),
 *         xmm0.f[0]);
 *
 * evaluated only while the setting is on. The names in it are the host's:
 * recomp_patch_set_var("aspect", 16.0 / 9.0), before the guest runs.
