/*
 * android_host.h - what an Android host needs that the POSIX layer has not.
 *
 * An Android app is a shared library in a process the system started: there
 * is no terminal behind stdout, the working directory is "/", HOME names
 * nothing writable and /proc/self/exe is the system's app_process. The
 * title's activity (Java) knows the app's directories and passes them in the
 * environment before the native code starts; this file does the rest.
 *
 * The environment the activity sets (android.system.Os.setenv, before
 * SDLActivity loads the libraries):
 *
 *   RECOMP_ANDROID_DIR   the app's own external files directory
 *                        (Context.getExternalFilesDir(null), e.g.
 *                        /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<package>/files):
 *                        the working directory, where the title's data folder
 *                        and enhance.toml are; readable over adb and MTP
 *   XDG_DATA_HOME        the same directory: recomp_save_dir() puts the save
 *                        folder under it, as on Linux
 *   XDG_CACHE_HOME       Context.getCacheDir(): the shader cache (the system
 *                        may empty it when storage runs short)
 *   RECOMP_ANDROID_DRIVER_DIR / RECOMP_ANDROID_LIB_DIR
 *                        reserved for a replacement GPU driver (not read yet)
 *
 * Android only; the header is empty elsewhere.
