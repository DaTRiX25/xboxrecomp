/*
 * recomp_restart.h - start the program again, as it was started.
 *
 * For a setting the runtime reads once at start (the render scale, the
 * speaker layout ...) or a save put in place before the title runs: the
 * program ends the ordinary way and comes back with the same arguments, in
 * the same directory, with the environment it was given.
 *
 * "As it was given" matters: a host puts its own defaults and the settings
 * file's values into the environment while it starts (env_default,
 * xbox_SettingsInit), and a program started with THAT environment would take
 * every one of them for the user's own variable. So recomp_restart_init, the
 * first call in main, copies the arguments, the working directory and the
 * environment, and registers the handler that does the restart with atexit
 * before anything else registers one: it therefore runs last, after the
 * settings are written, the pads' motors are stopped, the audio device is
 * closed and the log is finished, exactly as at any quit.
 *
 *   Linux, macOS   execve in place: the same process id. No second
 *                  instance at any moment; Steam still sees the game it
 *                  started, a launcher script that waits for it keeps
 *                  waiting, an AppImage's runtime (the parent holding the
 *                  mount) stays, a Mac bundle's executable is the same file.
 *   Windows        no exec in place: CreateProcessW with the same wide
 *                  command line, the saved environment block and directory,
 *                  as the last thing the old process does.
 *   Android        the activity restarts the app (a hook the window layer
 *                  installs: recomp_restart_set_hook); the process ends
 *                  there, not through exit.
