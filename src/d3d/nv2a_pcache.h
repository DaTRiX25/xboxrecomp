/*
 * nv2a_pcache.h - the on-disk pipeline-key list a GPU backend pre-warms from.
 *
 * A backend compiles a shader (or a pipeline) the first time a draw needs it,
 * on the NV2A ack thread, so every cold start stalls a frame on each one. This
 * file remembers what was compiled, as the backend's own keys (the vertex
 * program's slots, the combiner state, the pipeline's fixed state), so the
 * next start compiles them before the title draws with them. It stores keys,
 * not compiled code: the backend regenerates the source from a key, so a
 * changed generator never runs stale code, and a rebuild of the toolkit
 * keeps the list. The version string names what the keys mean (the backend's
 * key-format number and the sizes of the structures written as they are);
 * only a change there drops a file.
 *
 * The keys are the title's own data (a vertex program's slots are its
 * microcode, byte for byte as in its executable), so a list is made on the
 * player's machine and is not something to hand around.
 *
 * The approach is the one emulators converged on: Dolphin keeps a per-game
 * list of pipeline UIDs under a 'PUID' + GX_PIPELINE_UID_VERSION header and
 * compiles all of it at startup on its pre-compiler threads
 * (Source/Core/VideoCommon/ShaderCache.cpp, InitializeShaderCache and the
 * UID cache load; on Metal it replays only the UIDs, MTLUtil.mm turns the
 * binary caches off); xemu keeps its GL shader binaries under a header of
 * its version and the driver's, deletes a mismatch, and loads the list on a
 * background thread (hw/xbox/nv2a/pgraph/gl/shaders.c); UnleashedRecomp
 * ships a pipeline-state list it compiles during the intro logos and
 * compiles new ones on worker threads (UnleashedRecomp/gpu/video.cpp, the
 * pipeline pre-compilation and EnqueueGraphicsPipelineCompilation).
 *
 * File: a header (magic, format, the caller's version string), then records
 * { u32 type, u32 len, u64 fnv64(type, payload), payload[len] }, appended as
 * they are made. On open: a missing, foreign or wrong-version file is started
 * afresh (deleted); a record that fails its check ends the file there, and the
 * file is rewritten without the tail (a torn append from a killed process).
 * Appends are one fwrite + fflush each, so a killed process loses at most the
 * record being written. Identical records are written once.
 *
 * Threading: open, put and close on one thread; get/count only read what open
 * loaded and may run on any thread once open returned.
