/*
 * overlay.h - the in-game settings overlay (Dear ImGui), as the window's
 * presenter sees it.
 *
 * The presenter (src/video/fb_present_sdl.c and its Metal and Vulkan halves)
 * owns the window, its one event loop and the present, all on the process
 * main thread, and so does the overlay: ImGui is used from that thread only.
 *
 *   events    every SDL event of the main loop goes to xbox_OverlayEvent
 *             first. It watches for the hotkeys (Back+Start on a pad, F1,
 *             Cmd+, on macOS); Esc or B closes. While it is open the title
 *             reads no pad or key (xbox_InputSetBlocked) and is paused
 *             (xbox_HostPause); see overlay_ui.cpp.
 *   drawing   after the game's image is in the drawable and before it is
 *             presented, the presenter calls its backend's draw
 *             (overlay_metal.h, overlay_vulkan.h), when xbox_OverlayWants.
 *   backends  one source file per graphics API, each a few calls around the
 *             official imgui_impl_* renderer; D3D11 adds one more
 *             (overlay_internal.h lists what a backend provides).
 *
 * RECOMP_OVERLAY=0 turns the whole thing off; =open starts it open (for
 * screenshots). The settings it edits are xbox_settings.h.
