/*
 * overlay_gameart.h - the title's own menu pictures for the overlay (the
 * arrows and the cursor, the rounded corners of the value boxes, the tick
 * bar, the d-pad, the grid, the big arc, the button prompts), read at run
 * time from the player's copy of the title's data (xbox_settings.h,
 * xbox_OverlaySetGameArt), never from this repository.
 *
 * The sprites are small DXT images. A thread reads the file, checks its
 * SHA-256, decodes them, makes them 4x larger with Super-xBR and packs them
 * into two RGBA textures (one for the sprites, one for the prompt sheets of
 * every glyph set); nothing is written anywhere. Between two frames the main
 * thread hands the textures to Dear ImGui (gameart_attach), whose backends
 * upload them like the font atlas. Until then, and for good when the file is
 * missing or is not the expected one, nothing is drawn from here and the
 * overlay keeps the look it has without them.
