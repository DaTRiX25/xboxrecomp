/*
 * xbox_shader_build.h - a shader pre-build, as the settings overlay sees it.
 *
 * A host that can build its shaders ahead of time (it plays the title's
 * scenes in a child process, nv2a_pcache.h) gives the overlay these calls.
 * The overlay then has an action for it on the Graphics page, with the
 * progress, and offers it once at the first start: it opens on that row
 * with "Not now" and "Do not ask again" beside it. Nothing starts by
 * itself; closing the overlay stops a build (the title is paused while the
 * overlay is open, and a build beside a running title would cost it
 * frames). No SDL here: a host's C sources include it.
