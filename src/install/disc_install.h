/*
 * disc_install.h - the data installer: a title's files from the user's own
 * disc (an image, xdvdfs.h, or a folder already extracted from one) into the
 * folder the port reads them from, every file checked against a manifest.
 *
 * A port ships its program and none of the title's data. Its first start
 * hands a disc to this; what the program was built for is one exact disc, so
 * the manifest lists that disc's files (path, size, SHA-256) and anything
 * else is refused with what it is.
 *
 *   <dest>/<subdir>/...       the disc's files, as the manifest names them
 *   <dest>/install.journal    the files that are whole, a line each, while
 *                             an install is under way
 *   <dest>/.complete          written last: the install is whole
 *
 * A file is hashed while it is copied to <name>.part, compared, and renamed;
 * then its line goes into the journal. A run that was stopped (the process
 * killed, the machine switched off, the cancel callback) goes on where it
 * was: a file the journal lists is kept as it is, a file that is there
 * without a line is hashed where it lies, the rest are copied. The marker is
 * made when every file of the manifest is in place and the journal goes.
 * Files in the source that the manifest does not list are not copied.
 *
 * No runtime, no thread, no global state: the same code in a game's
 * executable (its --install), in an Android library behind a document
 * picker (source_fd), and in the tests.
